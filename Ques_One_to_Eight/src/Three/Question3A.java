package Three;

//You are given an even length array; divide it in half and return possible minimum product difference of any two subarrays.
//Note that the minimal product difference is the smallest absolute difference between any two arrays a and b, which is computed by calculating the difference after multiplying each element of the arrays a and b.
//Input: {5,2,4,11}
//Output: 2
//{5,4} {2,11} result into minimum product difference.
